\subsection{Motor}

The initial motor module has been completed which takes a discrete action and maps it consistently onto a movement direction which it then passes to the Environment. Whilst dragonfly motor control could be the subject of further research, it was deemed beyond the scope of the project and the controller currently restricts movement to $2n$ directions in $n$-dimensional space.
