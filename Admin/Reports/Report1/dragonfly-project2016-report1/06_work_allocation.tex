\section{Work Allocation}

\par Chris Snowden has been selected to be the leader of the project and is responsible for establishing collaboration methods and coordinating group meetings. Secretarial tasks will be assigned to a different person, rolling weekly, with overall supervision by Zoe Landgraf. Group members will be cycled between these modules as described in Section \ref{developmentMethodology}, to ensure all group members gain experience in working and understand the code for all modules. For the current sprint (2) the pairs are: Alex Carver and Georgios Kontogiannis (ESTMD), Chris Snowden and Luka Milic (CSTMD1) and Desy Kristianti and Zoe Landgraf (Environment, STDP, RL and Integration).
