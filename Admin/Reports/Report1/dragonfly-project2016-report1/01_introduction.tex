\section{Introduction}

\par This project is to develop a neural system that mimics the predatory behaviour of dragonflies, building on previous work \cite{GITHUB1} which has implemented parts of this simulation in a batch process. The particular interest in dragonflies' neural function arises from their efficiency during pursuit, based on selective neural activity. This selection mechanism is driven by the Centrifugal Small Target Motion-Detector Neuron 1 (CSTMD1).

The project's primary focus is to build a module simulating this CSTMD1 with a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model \cite{Hodgkin} and employ its selection mechanism in a biomimetic agent that exhibits attention-like target selection when performing a simple predation task. The existing modules comprise the functionalities of target detection, pattern recognition and reinforcement learning, as well as a simulation environment. In addition to the central component, the CSTMD1, a Motor Controller will be added, which coordinates the dragonflies' movement in the environment according to pattern recognition of the CSTMD1 output. In order to create a realistic system, the existing and new components will be integrated and adjusted to enable a continuous flow rather than batch execution, a necessity for the model to operate in a real environment.
